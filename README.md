### VBoxToolsScripts
## Virtualbox utilities' scripts suite 

Nowaday, only **VBoxGetIP** is useful as a working script for this matter ...

- **VBoxGetIP** : returns current IP(s) of the running Virtualbox VM(s).
- startvm_headless_*.sh : to modify yet ...
- startvm_headless.sh : this script will show a list of VM configured in your Virtualbox (including the ones in running states), and let you choose which to start headless from the list.
